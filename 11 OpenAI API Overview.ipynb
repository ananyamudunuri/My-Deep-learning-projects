Harry often prevails due to lucky plot turns and he was designated as the \"chosen one,\" pointing to a destined role rather than volunteer heroism. In addition, his heroic acts seem to stem from prophecy fulfillment and audience requirement rather than personal choice or bravery.\n",

Ron, without the compulsion of any prophecy, acts selflessly and bravely, such as when he faces a troll to save a friend. Neville also consistently rises to challenges, even when he has no particular prophecy or destiny requiring him to do so. They both act unhesitatingly when circumstances call for courage.\n",

Neville, initially a character characterized as clumsy and insignificant, parallels Peter Pettigrew from the previous generation. However, unlike Pettigrew, who betrays his friends, Neville remains loyal to Harry and ultimately defies Voldemort, displaying bravery and loyalty akin to a true hero.\n"
